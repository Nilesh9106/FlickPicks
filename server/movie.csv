The same building 20 years later becomes home to a brothel where a young unexploited concubine is dealing with her self-proclaimed ""first"" client who has a strange inability to fulfil his physical desire unless obligated to the duress of a transaction to do so. Now 30 years later these same walls surround a sublime home which belongs to a soul-stirring 75 year old couple who love laugh and dance together.
